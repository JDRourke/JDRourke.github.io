README lab: your portfilio

I worked on this lab for a little under 3 hours. I believe I have sucessfully 
created the three required pages. They definetly aren't pretty as I have 
little skill with the CSS portion, but they seem to pass all of the W3 
tests at least. I did not collaborate or discuss with anyone on this lab.
